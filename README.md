# webgl-gpu-power-estimation

Catering a 3d web-based experience to the power of a target platform is difficult with such a small amount of information available about the current graphics hardware. This utility aims to provide performance benchmark, clock speed, and memory information about the current hardware by guessing the type of graphics hardware using webgl `UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL` parameter and looking it up in a cached list of hardware.

See your hardware info [here](https://gkjohnson.github.io/webgl-gpu-power-estimation/example/)!

## License Information

Code in the `/src` directory is licensed under the MIT license and free to use. Scraped graphics card data in the `/data` directory is for demonstration purposes only and is subject to the terms of the respective source websites.

## Matching the Graphics Hardware Name

The values from `UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL` are irregular and relatively unpredictable. To find the corresponding hardware in the database list we

- Check if there is a version number in the current GPU hardware name.
- Filter the database of GPUs to those that include that version number (or to those that have no version number if none was found).
- From that list pick the hardware the has the most matching tokens between the names.

## Use

```js
import { getDetailedInfo, getBasicInfo } from 'gpu-power-estimate';

fetch( './path/to/database.json' )
  .then( res => res.json() )
  .then( database => {

    // get the hardware information
    const canvas = document.createElement( 'canvas' );
    const gl = canvas.getContext( 'webgl' );
    const basicInfo = getBasicInfo( gl );
    const detailedInfo = getDetailedInfo( database, gl );

    // scale the application
    const capability = detailedInfo ? detailedInfo.performance : 0;
    if ( capability > 6000 ) {

      // initialize highest fidelity scene

    } else if ( capability > 3000 ) {

      // initialize moderately complex scene

    } else {

      // initialize simplified scene

    }

  } );

```

## API

### getBasicInfo
```js
getBasicInfo( context = null : WebGLContext ) : Object | null
```

Returns some basic info about the hardware based on the `WEBGL_debug_renderer_info` extension or `null` if it's unavailable.

If the context is not provided then a temporary one will be created.

```js
{
  // The full graphics hardware
  name,

  // A guess as to whether or not the hardware is integrated graphics
  integrated,

  // The raw unmasked fields returned from the extension
  unmasked: { vendor, renderer }

}
```

### getDetailedInfo

```js
getDetailedInfo(
  database : Object,
  contextOrCard = null : WebGLContext | string
) : Object | null
```

Returns more detailed hardware information based on the information in the provided database. The database is expected to be an object where the keys are the names of graphics hardware and the values are objects with detail information.

If a WebGL context _or_ card name to search is not provided then a temporary context will be created.

The scraped example data provides the following information. Fields are null if unavailable. If no card is found _or_ `WEBGL_debug_renderer_info` is unavailable then `null` is returned.
```js
{

  // Name of the GPU
  name,

  // Type of graphics card
  // Workstation, Desktop, Mobile, Unknown
  type,

  // The 3d and 2d performance results as provided by the
  // PassMark g3d and g2d benchmarks
  performance,

  // thermal design power
  tdp,

  // total available vram in MB
  memory,

  // clock speeds in MHz
  clock,
  memoryClock

}
```

### Caveats

For privacy reasons the availability of the `UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL` parameter may be disabled in which case no estimate can be provided.
